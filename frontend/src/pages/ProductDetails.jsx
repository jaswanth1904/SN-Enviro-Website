These typically include Pulsed UV Fluorescence for SO2, Chemiluminescence for NOx, Gas Filter Correlation (GFC) for CO, and UV Photometry for Ozone. Additionally, Beta Attenuation Monitors (BAM) are employed for the precise mass measurement of Particulate Matter (PM10 and PM2.5).",

            longDescription: "Data integrity is the backbone of environmental compliance. Our IIoT-based Data Loggers remove the gap between field analyzers and central servers. They act as secure gateways that collect analog and digital signals from analyzers, buffer the data locally to prevent loss during network outages, and push it to CPCB/SPCB servers using approved protocols.\n\nBeyond simple logging, the Remote Calibration Unit (RCU) feature allows operators to trigger zero and span calibration cycles remotely from the cloud. This reduces site visits and ensures analyzer drift is corrected immediately. The system also monitors instrument health tags, predicting failures before they happen.",
